A self-hosted WordPress plugin using Expo to send custom push notifications. Own your data, bypass OneSignal, and keep your pack in the loop with a wag.

== Description ==

TailSignal lets you send push notifications to your mobile app users directly from WordPress using the Expo Push Service. No third-party notification services needed.

**Key Features:**

* **Self-hosted** — Your data stays on your server
* **Expo Push API** — Works with any Expo/React Native app
* **Auto-notify** — Automatically send notifications when posts are published
* **Manual send** — Send custom notifications from the admin dashboard
* **Scheduling** — Schedule notifications for later delivery via WP-Cron
* **Device groups** — Organize devices into groups for targeted sends
* **Rich notifications** — Include featured images in push notifications
* **Dev Mode** — Test notifications on your own devices without sending to everyone
* **Export/Import** — CSV export and import for device management
* **Template system** — Customizable notification templates with placeholders
* **Post editor integration** — Meta box for per-post notification control with quick send
* **Clean uninstall** — All custom tables, options, and capabilities are removed on deletion

**Template Placeholders:**

* `{post_title}` — Post title
* `{post_excerpt}` — First 20 words of content
* `{site_name}` — WordPress site name
* `{author_name}` — Post author display name
* `{category}` — Primary category name

**REST API Endpoints:**

* `POST /wp-json/tailsignal/v1/register` — Register a device (public)
* `DELETE /wp-json/tailsignal/v1/register` — Unregister a device (public)
* `POST /wp-json/tailsignal/v1/send` — Send or schedule a notification (admin)
* `GET /wp-json/tailsignal/v1/stats` — Dashboard statistics (admin)
* `GET /wp-json/tailsignal/v1/devices/export` — Export devices as CSV (admin)
* `POST /wp-json/tailsignal/v1/devices/import` — Import devices from CSV (admin)

For full API documentation, see the [GitHub README](https://github.com/mrdemonwolf/TailSignal).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `tailsignal` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install via the WordPress plugin uploader
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to TailSignal > Settings to configure Dev Mode, templates, and Expo Access Token
4. In your Expo/React Native app, register device tokens via the REST API

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What mobile framework does this work with? =

TailSignal works with any app built using Expo/React Native that uses Expo Push Tokens.

= Do I need an Expo account? =

You don't need a paid Expo account. The Expo Push Service is free. You can optionally add an Expo Access Token for authentication.

= What is Dev Mode? =

Dev Mode lets you test notifications by only sending to devices flagged as "dev". This prevents accidentally sending test notifications to all your users. Toggle it in TailSignal > Settings.

= Can I send to specific groups of devices? =

Yes! Create device groups (e.g., "Beta Testers", "VIP") under TailSignal > Groups and target notifications to specific groups when sending.

= Does this support rich notifications with images? =

Yes. When "Include Featured Image" is enabled in settings, the post's featured image is sent as a rich notification that displays on both iOS and Android.

= What happens when I uninstall the plugin? =

TailSignal performs a clean uninstall — all 6 custom database tables, all plugin options, custom capabilities, and post meta are removed. No data is left behind.

= How do I register a device from my mobile app? =

Send a POST request to `/wp-json/tailsignal/v1/register` with the Expo push token and device info. See the GitHub README for a full code example.
